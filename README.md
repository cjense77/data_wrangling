Welcome to my data wrangling repository. Currently, this reposity contains work that I did in the Fall of 2017 for MATH 335: Data Wrangling and Visualization. These are some of my first attempts at data science. Hence, you will notice the later projects are more polished than the earlier ones. 

# To R, Or Not to R?

The main platform for the analysis of the class was R, but being fully indoctrinated into Python, I decided that I would march to the beat of my own drum. This gave me a unique opportunity throughout the semester to compare R and Python side-by-side. For context, most the analysis I did in R was using Hadley Wickham's tidyverse, and most of the analyss I did in Python was using Pandas. After using both tools, here's my take on the R vs. Python discussion.

In terms of performing data analysis, R is like a fancy restaurant. At a restaurant, you tend to end up with something delicious because the chef is likely to only put items on the menu that she cooks well. In this way, R excels. Especially when paired with a powerful IDE like RStudio and a few choice packages such as Hadley Wickham's tidyverse, R provides a robust and user-friendly platform for data analysis. However, a programmer coming into R from a more comphresensive language will likely find themselves frustrated by the inflexibility of the base R language. Continuing with our restaurant analogy, say you wanted your salmon filet pan-fried instead of steamed. If it's not on the menu, you're probably out of luck. Similarly, becuase R was created with statistics and data science in mind, it is sometimes quite cumbersome to implement a program not related to those fields. 

Python, on the other hand, is like your own kitchen. The quality of the food depends primarily on the skill of the chef. A professional can produce something delicious completely customized. A novice, however, is likely to produce a disaster on his first few attempts. Python wasn't built for doing data analysis. That fact is evidenced by the relative immaturity of data science and visualization packages such as Pandas, Agate, Bokeh, and PyGal. While they are certainly useful and quickly improving, they lack the simplicity and user-friendliness of their R equivalents. In the hands of a professional, wonderful and delicious things can be accomplished, but tyros need to be prepared for a steep learning curve.
